--@name External file inclusion
-- if you wish to execute code contained in an external file instead,
-- use the require-directive, e.g.:

require 'myExternalFile'

-- Above will look for <V-REP executable path>/myExternalFile.lua or
-- <V-REP executable path>/lua/myExternalFile.lua
-- (the file can be opened in this editor with the popup menu over
-- the file name)
